## About 
This portfolio showcases brief information about myself, my skills in the area of Web Development and Designing. It also portrays some fun hobbies of mine in well-designed pages for each of them, such as playing cards and juggling. At the end there is a contact me section implemented to which help users to directly send a mail to me. 
## Features
### 1. Responsive Design
The website is designed to be accessible and visually appealing on various devices and screen sizes.
### 2. Navigation Bar
Implemented a navigation bar which helps users to easily navigate throughout the main page using `Bootstrap`.
### 3. Interactive Elements
Added lots of interactive elements such as hovering effects, buttons, color changes, hyperlinking, videos etc. 
Here is a list of the interactive elements on the main page:-
- Hovering effects on the navigation bar, header and the footer
- Hovering effects on the 'Greetings' section, so it greets in different languages when hovered
- Personal image resizes when hovered upon and opens LinkedIn when clicked
- Contact me button to post a mail
- Footer Icons open respective handles
### 4. Contact Button
A contact button so users can directly post a mail.
### 5. Footer Section
Interactive footer section which contains social platforms and copyright marks.
### 6. Hobbies
Designed personalised pages for 5 different hobbies. Here is a brief outlook about each of them:-
- ##### Programming and WebDev :- 
  Fonts and color schemes match to give a 'computer' based look. Design is simple and not too sophisticated to add a       professional look. A button which opens a simple meme that I designed using basic HTML and CSS.
- ##### Reading Mangas :-
  Color scheme to showcase classical manga based colors, and fonts to add a joyous look. Images resize and change opacity, with the current background, it acts as if the images are glowing. A button at the end which pops up a simple alert.
- ##### Playing Cards :-
  Red and Black background to match the colour of the standard cards. Hovering effects for the images. A fun random-card- generator added in the end using javascript, which generates a random card each time the button is pressed, using the `Math.random()` function.
- ##### Juggling :-
  Simple color scheme and joyous font. Added an interactive video using the HTML `video` element. Sized the video using appropriate dimensions to fit all screen sizes.
- ##### Typing :-
  Colour scheme and fonts to match the `monkeytype` website. Added a beautiful carousel which showcases my typing journey using `Bootstrap`.
## Technologies Used
Here are the programming languages/libraries used:-
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap
## Philosophy of the Website
I've tried to keep the website as simple and minimalistic as possible while also keeping it engaging, which I think quite suits myself. I thought the main page should reflect the developer of the website. This made me design the main page using a simple desert-based theme. I chose this specific theme as I believe it portrays serenity, sublime-character, and humility. The font is simple and easy to read, which matches the theme. The rest of the pages match the theme of the hobby itself, which I believe blends in well with the project objectives.
## Things that did not work
These are some of the things that did not work:-
- Wanted to add a sliding image in the main page, which appears as the user scrolls.
- Created a contact form but could not directly connect it to the mail, as in could not store the entered information. (I have added the HTML and CSS code of the form in the repository.
- Wanted to add background images for some of the pages, but could not make them responsive enough

I believe joining the team would help me further gain skills and abilities to learn tons of new things, work with a group of like-minded people, easily be able to handle the above mentioned stuff and other similar problems.
