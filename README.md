## Features
### 1. Responsive Design
The website is designed to be accessible and visually appealing on various devices and screen sizes.

### 3. Interactive Elements
Added lots of interactive elements such as hovering effects, buttons, color changes, hyperlinking, videos etc. 
Here is a list of the interactive elements on the main page:-
- Hovering effects on the navigation bar, header and the footer
- Hovering effects on the 'Greetings' section, so it greets in different languages when hovered
- Personal image resizes when hovered upon and opens LinkedIn when clicked

### 4. Contact Button
A contact button so users can directly post a mail.
### 5. Footer Section
Interactive footer section which contains social platforms and copyright marks.
### 6. Hobbies
Designed personalised pages for 5 different hobbies. Here is a brief outlook about each of them:-
- ##### Programming and WebDev :- 
  Fonts and color schemes match to give a 'computer' based look. Design is simple and not too sophisticated to add a       professional look. A button which opens a simple meme that I designed using basic HTML and CSS.
- ##### Reading Mangas :-
  Color scheme to showcase classical manga based colors, and fonts to add a joyous look. Images resize and change opacity, with the current background, it acts as if the images are glowing. A button at the end which pops up a simple alert.
- ##### Playing Cards :-
  Red and Black background to match the colour of the standard cards. Hovering effects for the images. A fun random-card- generator added in the end using javascript, which generates a random card each time the button is pressed, using the `Math.random()` function.
- ##### Juggling :-
  Simple color scheme and joyous font. Added an interactive video using the HTML `video` element. Sized the video using appropriate dimensions to fit all screen sizes.
- ##### Typing :-
  Colour scheme and fonts to match the `monkeytype` website. Added a beautiful carousel which showcases my typing journey using `Bootstrap`.
